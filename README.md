## About Me

I'm an electrical engineering graduate student focused on **digital hardware design and functional verification**. I build RTL and SystemVerilog/UVM testbenches, develop independent reference models, and use assertions, functional coverage, and simulation evidence to check design behavior.

Alongside my graduate studies, I am an **ASIC Design Verification Trainee at Maven Silicon**.

My projects span packet routing, APB peripherals, synchronous FIFOs, and processor design. As a **Graduate Teaching Assistant for ECE 252 at Colorado State University**, I lead three labs each week and help students take digital circuits from Boolean logic to FPGA implementation. I also work with Python and TensorFlow on signal-processing and machine-learning projects.

## Professional Experience

### ASIC Design Verification Trainee · Maven Silicon

**January 2026 – Present**

## Teaching Experience

### Graduate Teaching Assistant · Colorado State University

**ECE 252 — Introduction to Digital Circuits · Fall 2026**  
Working with **Prof. Anura Jayasumana**

- Lead **three laboratory sessions each week**, guiding students from truth tables and Karnaugh maps through Quartus, RTL design, simulation, and FPGA implementation on the **DE10-Lite**.
- Hold office hours on Boolean algebra, flip-flops, and Mealy and Moore finite-state machines.
- Help students identify unintended latches, trace incorrect state transitions, and debug differences between simulation and FPGA behavior.
- Evaluate lab reports and help students explain how logic, timing, and state transitions affect their results.

#### Hardware Build: 8-Bit Nanoprocessor

For the lab interview, I designed an **8-bit nanoprocessor from scratch in Quartus** and demonstrated it on the **DE10-Lite FPGA platform**. The design included a gate-level adder/subtractor, a **4×4 array multiplier**, a control ROM, and a register bank.

Teaching these fundamentals strengthens how I reason about RTL, debug hardware, and explain design decisions.

## Selected Projects

### [1×3 Packet Router — RTL & UVM Verification](https://github.com/Charan6556/router-1x3-uvm)

An 8-bit packet router with one input and three output FIFOs, verified with coordinated UVM agents, packet scoreboarding, directed boundary cases, constrained-random traffic, parity-error injection, and bound FIFO/FSM assertions.

- **Recorded Xcelium regression:** 5,024 matched packets, zero mismatches, and **100% of the defined functional coverage model**.
- **Checker validation:** a separate recorded mutation test detected 74 mismatched packets after intentional output corruption.
- **Design flow:** Verilator lint, Yosys synthesis, and SKY130 technology mapping.

### [APB Multi-Slave — Protocol & UVM Verification](https://github.com/Charan6556/APB-Multi-Slave-UVM-Verification)

An APB subsystem with two memory-mapped slaves, including zero-wait and two-wait-state responses.

- Built requester-side stimulus, a completed-transfer monitor, per-slave reference memories, and readback checking.
- Added assertions for protocol sequencing, slave selection, and signal stability during wait states.
- **Recorded run:** 20 monitored transfers, **100% of the defined functional coverage model**, and zero UVM warnings, errors, or fatals.

### [Synchronous FIFO — RTL & UVM Verification](https://github.com/Charan6556/Synchronous-FIFO-UVM-Verification)

A parameterized FIFO with an independent queue-based scoreboard and assertions for reset, occupancy, and pointer behavior.

- Checked full/empty boundaries, data ordering, and blocked overflow/underflow attempts with directed fill-and-drain sequences.
- **Recorded run:** 16 accepted writes, 16 accepted reads, no remaining reference entries, and zero UVM warnings, errors, or fatals.

### [RV32I Processor — Ongoing Development](https://github.com/Charan6556/RISCV-32I)

A SystemVerilog processor project progressing from a single-cycle implementation toward a pipelined architecture.

- **Completed milestone:** single-cycle processor.
- **In progress:** pipelining and hazard handling.
- **Roadmap:** AXI4-Lite integration and UVM verification.

- **[ECG Arrhythmia Classification](https://github.com/Charan6556/ECG-Arrhythmia-Classification):** An educational five-class heartbeat classifier using Python, TensorFlow, a 1D CNN, signal preprocessing, and an experimental ECG trace-extraction pipeline. The repository documents recorded results and evaluation limitations.

## How I Approach Verification

- **Model expected behavior independently** so DUT status signals cannot hide their own bugs.
- **Start with boundaries and corner cases:** reset, full/empty transitions, protocol wait states, and malformed traffic.
- **Check the checker** by confirming that intentional corruption produces failures.
- **Connect claims to evidence:** retain scoreboards, coverage summaries, waveforms, and the scope of each recorded run.
